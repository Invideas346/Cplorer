# Cplorer
A console based file explorer for linux and windows.

## Building
For unix like systems the building process is rather straight forward.

###### Dependencies
```
sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev libboost-all-dev
```

For Windows the ncurses library has to be compiled and added e.g. 
to the lib-folder of the mingw compiler.
